class ResilientClient:
    """
    A resilient asynchronous HTTP client implementing modern resilience patterns.

    This client combines multiple resilience patterns to create a production-ready
    HTTP client that can handle various failure scenarios gracefully:

    **Resilience Patterns Implemented:**

    1. **Connection Pooling**: Uses a long-lived httpx.AsyncClient to maintain
       persistent connections, reducing overhead and improving performance.

    2. **Circuit Breaker**: Monitors connection failures and switches to "fail-fast"
       mode when a service becomes unhealthy, preventing cascading failures.
       - CLOSED: Normal operation
       - OPEN: Failing fast after threshold failures
       - HALF_OPEN: Testing if service has recovered

    3. **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Automatically retries failed requests
       with increasing delays and optional jitter to prevent thundering herd effects.

    4. **Bulkhead Pattern**: Limits concurrent requests using semaphores to prevent
       resource exhaustion and protect upstream services.

    5. **Idempotency**: Automatically generates X-Request-ID headers to enable
       safe retries and duplicate request detection.

    **Usage Examples:**

    Basic usage with default configuration:
    ```python
    from client import ClientConfig, ResilientClient

    config = ClientConfig(base_url="https://api.example.com")

    async with ResilientClient(config) as client:
        response = await client.get("/users/123")
        print(response.status_code)
    ```

    Advanced configuration for high-latency environments:
    ```python
    from client import ClientConfig, TimeoutConfig, RetryConfig

    config = ClientConfig(
        base_url="https://api.example.com",
        timeout=TimeoutConfig(
            connect=10.0,    # Allow longer connection time
            read=60.0        # Allow longer response time
        ),
        retry=RetryConfig(
            max_attempts=5,  # More retries for unreliable networks
            max_wait_seconds=120.0  # Longer backoff for slow services
        )
    )
    ```

    **Pattern Interaction Flow:**

    1. Request initiated â†’ Bulkhead pattern acquires semaphore slot
    2. Circuit breaker checks if service is healthy (CLOSED state)
    3. Retry wrapper executes the HTTP request with exponential backoff
    4. Each retry failure is reported to circuit breaker
    5. Success resets circuit breaker state and releases semaphore

    **Exception Hierarchy:**

    - APIConnectionError: Retryable errors (network, timeouts, 5xx)
    - APIStatusError: Non-retryable errors (4xx client errors)
    - PoolTimeoutError: Bulkhead pattern timeout (too many concurrent requests)

    **Best Practices:**

    - Use as an async context manager to ensure proper cleanup
    - Configure timeouts appropriate for your service's SLA
    - Set circuit breaker thresholds based on acceptable failure rates
    - Monitor logs for pattern behavior insights
    - Use request_id parameter for request tracing and debugging

    **Threading and Async Safety:**

    This client is designed for asyncio environments and maintains thread-safe
    state using asyncio.Lock for circuit breaker operations and asyncio.Semaphore
    for concurrency limiting.

        Make an HTTP request with full resilience pattern implementation.

        This method orchestrates all resilience patterns in the correct order to
        create a robust HTTP request pipeline. Understanding this flow is crucial
        for junior engineers to see how patterns work together.

        **Resilience Pattern Execution Order:**

        1. **Idempotency Setup**: Add X-Request-ID header for duplicate detection
        2. **Bulkhead Pattern**: Acquire semaphore slot (with timeout protection)
        3. **Circuit Breaker Check**: Verify if service is healthy enough to try
        4. **Retry Loop**: Execute request with exponential backoff retry logic
        5. **Exception Mapping**: Convert httpx exceptions to semantic API exceptions
        6. **State Updates**: Update circuit breaker based on success/failure
        7. **Resource Cleanup**: Always release semaphore slot

        **Why This Order Matters:**

        - Bulkhead comes first to prevent resource exhaustion
        - Circuit breaker prevents wasted retries when service is known to be down
        - Retry loop is inside circuit breaker so the entire retry sequence counts
          as one operation for circuit breaker state management
        - Exception mapping provides consistent error contracts to calling code
        - Cleanup happens in finally block to ensure resources are always released

        **Educational Example - What Happens During Failures:**

        ```
        Request 1: Network timeout
        â†’ Bulkhead: Acquired slot âœ“
        â†’ Circuit: CLOSED state, proceed âœ“
        â†’ Retry: Attempt 1 fails, wait 1s, retry
        â†’ Retry: Attempt 2 fails, wait 2s, retry
        â†’ Retry: Attempt 3 fails, raise exception
        â†’ Circuit: Increment failure count (1/5)
        â†’ Cleanup: Release semaphore slot

        Request 6: After 5 failures...
        â†’ Circuit: Failure threshold reached, circuit OPENS
        â†’ Future requests: Fail fast without hitting network
        ```

        Args:
            method: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
            url: Request URL (relative to base_url or absolute)
            request_id: Unique request ID for idempotency and correlation tracking
            **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to httpx (headers, json, etc.)

        Returns:
            HTTP response object on success

        Raises:
            APIConnectionError: Retryable errors (network, timeout, 5xx server errors)

            PoolTimeoutError: Bulkhead pattern timeout (too many concurrent requests)
            RetryError: All retry attempts exhausted

        **Performance Considerations:**

        - Connection pooling reduces TCP handshake overhead
        - Semaphore prevents overwhelming target service
        - Circuit breaker reduces latency during outages
        - Jitter in retry timing prevents thundering herd effects
